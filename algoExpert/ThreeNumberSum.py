# Three Number Sum

# Given a non-empty array of distinct integers and a target sum, return triplets of integers that add up to target
# Numbers in the triplets should be ordered in ascending order, list of triplets should also be ordered in ascending order

# Get all the combinations for 2 numbers, then check the difference to see if there is a
# number that add up to the sum
