# System Design and Scalability

Demonstrate how you would approach this problem if you were working there

### Handling the Question

1. communicate with the interviewer, ask a lot of questions and voice your thought process, what is good
   and/or bad about your approach to solve the system design
2. Go broad first, make sure you get the context of the problem. Understand how you can answer the
   Who, What, When, Where, What, How question
3. Draw your thoughts and design on the whiteboard. Pictures help a lot with conveying what you want to express
   and also help your thought process
4. Acknowledge the interviewers concern if he has any. DO NOT brush them off.
5. Identify issues if / when you see them and talk through them with the interviewer and redesign to minimize if necessary
6. Make sure to make reasonable assumptions.
7. Ask the interviewer to validate that your assumptions are in scope
8. Make estimates when you can't provide a concrete number and back it up with why you came up with this estimate
9. Make sure to stay in the drivers seat and control the conversation / flow of the interview

### Key concepts

horizontal and vertical scalling
load balancer
database denormalization and NoSQL
database partitioning(sharding)

- vertical partitioning
- key-based / hash-based partitioning
- directory-based partitioning

caching
asynchronous processing and queues
network metrics

- bandwidth
- throughput
- latency
  MapReduce

### Considerations

How to handle failures
Ensure availability and reliability
Read-heavy vs. Write heavy
Security

### There are no perfect systems

There's always going to be tradeoffs
