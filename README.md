Below are resources I've been using. I found that reading through Cracking the Coding Interview was a bit dry and just doing LeetCode wasn't
helping me understand the problems since many questions don't have solutions with explanations. I bought AlgoExpert and I really
like they're content so far. They do a good job explaining the material, especially Clement's explanations.

## AlgoExpert

I'm solving the problems on on AlgoExpert and keeping track of them in this repo.
Some of my solutions are based off of their explanations but I try not to copy the solution unless I understand how to solve it.
If you are also doing coding interview prep I highly recommend them. They're pricing is very reasonable compared to other platforms
that do a worse job teaching the material. Check them out at: [algoexpert.io](https://www.algoexpert.io/)
Most, if not all of their questions can be found on LeetCode but their value proposition is the explanations that they give IMO.

## Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition

I'm slowly working my way through cracking the coding interview and have transcribed some of the solutions given in Java into Python.

## LeetCode

I attend Daily Leetcode within a the Recurse Center community I'm part of; I need to go more often. I also attended a meetup series
that focused on algorithms and data structures coding interviews with Women Who Code and those have been fun. Doing coding problems
with others is a nice change of pace sometimes.
